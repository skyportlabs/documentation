# Yummy Vanilla Cake Recipe 🍰

## What You Need:

- **1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour** (like the stuff you use for cookies!)
- **1 cup sugar** (the sweet stuff!)
- **1/2 cup butter** (that’s half a stick, and it needs to be soft)
- **2 large eggs** (fresh from the fridge!)
- **1/2 cup milk** (from a cow or your favorite carton)
- **1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder** (makes the cake rise!)
- **1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract** (for that yummy vanilla flavor)
- **1/4 teaspoon salt** (just a pinch!)

## How to Make It:

1. **Heat Up the Oven**:
   - Set your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a round or square baking pan.

2. **Mix the Dry Stuff**:
   - In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. They’re the dry ingredients!

3. **Beat the Butter and Sugar**:
   - In a big bowl, use a mixer to beat the butter and sugar until it’s all fluffy and light.

4. **Add Eggs and Vanilla**:
   - Crack the eggs and mix them into the butter and sugar, one at a time. Add the vanilla extract and stir.

5. **Mix It All Together**:
   - Gradually add the flour mixture and milk to the butter mix, switching between them. Mix just until everything’s combined.

6. **Pour and Smooth**:
   - Pour the batter into your pan and smooth it out with a spatula or spoon.

7. **Bake Time**:
   - Put it in the oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes. You can check if it’s done by poking a toothpick in the middle. If it comes out clean, it’s ready!

8. **Cool Down**:
   - Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, move it to a rack to cool completely.

## Extra Fun:
- You can put icing or sprinkles on top when it’s cool. Or, just eat it plain!

Enjoy your yummy cake! 🎂😊
